This project aims to use a package name of your preference locally without the need to change the CI configuration of your project to use this same package.

At first, the compatibiliation is made between pnpm and npm, where npm will be the cloud package and pnpm used local. This itself already offer much less space and internet consumed for you, my fellow developer! And if your fellow developer doesn't want to use pnpm, that's okay! He can stick with npm and everyone will be happy!
